      `NOT LONG AFTER RUSSIA’S full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022,
        Mikaela—who worked as a nurse and was trained as a medic—was deployed to
        the Ukrainian frontline. [1] She entrusted her daughter, Vika, with her
        mother, as many soldiers and medics did for the sake of their country’s
        territorial defense. When Mikaela came home on temporary leave, Vika was
        gone. <br /><br />
        At first, the truth was so difficult to hear that Mikaela felt
        dizzy and disoriented. It was like the oxygen had been sucked out of the
        room. <br /><br />
        Mikaela’s mother recounted the day Vika didn’t come home from
        school. Mikaela’s brother Vlad had picked up his niece after school, per
        their usual routine. But unbeknownst to Mikaela’s mother, instead of
        taking her home, he put her on a bus destined for a “reeducation” camp
        in Russia. <br /><br />
        Mikaela and Vlad had often disagreed about the war. She is a
        patriotic Ukrainian unwaveringly committed to her country’s survival.
        She saw the invasion as criminal, a violation of her country’s
        territorial sovereignty. Vlad viewed the invasion as part of a
        corrective—a “cleansing” measure. After he started calling Mikaela names
        like “Nazi” and “fascist” in a sardonic tone, they stopped speaking. In
        a kind of sibling rivalry on steroids, Vlad took advantage of Mikaela’s
        absence to claim Vika was without parental care and hand her over to
        occupying Russian authorities. He capitalized on recent Russian
        legislation that simplifies the process through which Ukrainian children
        can be granted Russian citizenship, paving the way to their permanent
        residence in Russia. Mikaela was in shock. <br /><br />
        Her daughter’s rumpled pillow
        still smelled like her favorite shampoo. Her plush toys were lined up,
        unscathed, on a shelf. It seemed as if Vika might walk back into the
        room at any moment. But in fact, she was hundreds of miles away. And
        Mikaela didn’t know how—or if—she could get her back. A person in a blue
        shirt stares out an opening on the side of a storied building where a
        window was. The structure has no windows left, smashed balconies, and
        burned and broken walls. <br /><br />
        A Russian rocket attack demolished this apartment building in Kyiv, Ukraine, during the invasion in 2022.
        Manhhai/Flickr The estimated number of children sent unlawfully from
        Ukraine to Russia since the full-scale invasion varies widely, from
        20,000 to 750,000. Child removal is a way for Russia to claim the
        Ukrainian children it has not killed with missile or drone strikes.
        Through a vast network of shelters and camps, Russians and their
        supporters provide kids with Russian identity documents, indoctrinate
        them into pro-Russian beliefs, and, in many cases, send them to foster
        and adoptive families. Through this insidious method of genocide, Russia
        is furthering its goal of annihilating modern Ukraine.

        One child at a
        time. THE PERSONAL SIDE OF THE WAR ON UKRAINE Among the most iconic
        images of Ukraine under Russian bombardment are those depicting
        residences with walls or ceilings sheared off. Viewers see the stove
        with the tea kettle still on it, a couch littered with shards of glass,
        and books still lined up on a shelf above the rubble. These images
        provide a catalog of how Russian aggression has targeted civilian
        infrastructure—a violation of international humanitarian law. The gaze
        from the outside is incomplete, however, without a view from within. My
        recently published book, Everyday War: The Conflict Over Donbas,
        Ukraine, reverses the usual vantage point to show readers what the war
        is like from the inside out. The literature on war usually treats
        personal life as a backdrop for the “real” action. This book explores
        personal relationships directly to show the difference they make for
        survival, the dignity of the dead, and the outcome of Russia’s war on
        Ukraine that began in 2014 and escalated into a full-scale invasion in
        2022. As a cultural anthropologist who has carried out extensive
        fieldwork across Ukraine, I developed the term “everyday war” to refer
        to the deliberate ways noncombatants engage with the military
        aggression, blurring the distinction between civilian and combatant.
        They assemble Molotov cocktails in the park, dismantle road signs in the
        streets to disorient invading forces, and personally deliver groceries
        or medical supplies to the front. As many Ukrainian people have said,
        every Ukrainian has to be a warrior now. 
        <br /><br />
        Societies are not just
        destroyed through military aggression from the outside, but also from
        within. I was inspired to devote my research to the role of
        relationships in war when people in Ukraine told me that some of their
        greatest suffering came from the destruction of friend and family
        relationships. In fact, nearly 70 percent of the 150 people I
        interviewed between 2015 and 2018 mourned the loss of close
        relationships due to the war. These shattered connections, child
        removals, and indoctrination efforts—often orchestrated by the child’s
        family, teachers, and caretakers—illustrate a core finding from Everyday
        War: Societies are not just destroyed through military aggression from
        the outside, but also from within. 
        <br /><br />
        GENOCIDE THROUGH INDOCTRINATION A
        Ukrainian friend living in Russian-occupied Crimea told me that one day
        when she picked up her son from school, the usually loquacious and
        exuberant kid folded his arms, frowned, and refused to say anything. For
        a while, her queries about what had happened yielded only “Nothing!” and
        “I’m fine!” A few days later, however, he blurted it out: His teachers
        at a Crimean school had told him Ukrainians are “killers,” “criminals,”
        and “Banderovtsi.” [2] The boy had concluded that because his mother
        watches Ukrainian TV through a virtual private network connection and
        often weeps over what she sees, she must be a “traitor.” That word is
        among the worst things one can be called in today’s Russia and Ukraine.
        My friend’s eyes welled up with tears as she told me this story,
        recalling the rift between her and her son. She realized the
        Russian-backed regime was “splitting his mind in two”; it was the
        government’s express intention to indoctrinate children into
        anti-Ukrainian views. Based on what had happened to her son, she and her
        husband decided to leave their beloved Crimea and bring the family to a
        Ukrainian-controlled city.

   <em>Understanding Gender-Based Violence (GBV)</em><br /><br />
  
  Gender-Based Violence (GBV) encompasses acts of physical, sexual, economic, and psychological harm directed against individuals based on gender differences. Recognized globally as a violation of fundamental human rights, GBV predominantly affects women and children, presenting significant health burdens, intergenerational effects, and demographic consequences.
  <br /><br />
  
  <strong>Types of GBV</strong> <br />
  
  GBV manifests in various forms:
  
  <br />
  1. Physical Violence: Includes beating, injuries caused by weapons, throwing objects, threats with weapons, female genital mutilation (FGM), and circumcision.<br />
  2. Sexual Violence: Encompasses marital rape, forced sex in relationships, rape by strangers, defilement, sodomy, sexual harassment, and forced or early marriages.<br />
  3. Economic Violence: Involves withdrawal of financial support, selling of partners' or shared property without consent, and refusal to provide food.<br />
  4. Emotional Violence: Covers verbal abuse, yelling, insults, humiliation, control by a partner, and extramarital affairs.<br />
  <br />
  
  <strong>Prevalence and Impact</strong><br />
  
  Research indicates that the experience of violence among women increases with age. For instance, 20% of women aged 15-19 have experienced physical violence since age 15, compared to 42% of women aged 40-49. Marital status also correlates with violence, with 41% of married women experiencing violence compared to 20% of unmarried women. In Bungoma, 62% of women have experienced physical violence since age 15, the highest in the country, while Mandera reports the lowest at 9%.<br />
  <br />
  
  Men, too, report significant experiences of interpersonal violence, often perpetrated by teachers, parents, and other men. Among married or formerly married individuals, the most common perpetrators of physical violence against women are current or former husbands/partners (54% and 34%, respectively). For men, the most common perpetrators are teachers (28%) and current wives/partners (19%).
  <br /><br />
  
  <strong>Addressing GBV in Kenya</strong> <br />
  Kenya's strategy to combat GBV involves a multifaceted approach:
  <br />
  1. Legal Framework: <br />
     - The 2010 Constitution of Kenya.<br />
     - National policies and international treaties, including the National Guidelines on Management of Sexual Violence in Kenya, the National Policy for Prevention and Response to GBV, the GBV Action Plan, and the Monitoring and Evaluation framework for GBV prevention and response.<br />
     - Legal provisions such as the Penal Code, the Sexual Offenses Act 2006, and the Children Act 2001.<br />
     - The Employment Act.<br /><br />
  
  2. Institutional Framework:<br />
     - Social protection sector reforms.<br />
     - Establishment of gender desks and Policare units.<br />
     - Budget allocations by the National Treasury.<br />
     - Specific objectives in the 2022 Kenya Demographic Health Survey (KDHS), including tracking domestic violence and female genital cutting.<br /><br />
  
  3. Commitment to Eradication by 2026:<br />
     In June 2021, Kenya committed to eradicating GBV by 2026, underscored by a comprehensive plan of 12 initiatives categorized into laws and policies, financing, data, service delivery, and accountability.<br /><br />
  
  4. Financing:<br />
     - Investing $23 million for GBV prevention and response by 2022 and increasing to $50 million by 2026.<br />
     - Allocating $1 million annually for GBV research and innovation.<br />
     - Establishing a GBV survivors' fund through a co-financing model with the private sector, civil society, and other stakeholders.<br /><br />
  
  5. Data:<br />
     - Incorporating a GBV module in the 2022 Kenya Demographic Health Survey.<br />
     - Developing a GBV management and information system to enhance prevention and response.<br /><br />
  
  6. Service Delivery:<br />
     - Integrating GBV services into the essential minimum package of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2022.<br />
     - Scaling up the national police service's integrated response (Policare) and establishing GBV recovery centers and shelters in all 47 counties by 2026.<br />
     - Addressing GBV in crisis situations, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, humanitarian contexts, and electoral-related violence.<br /><br />
  
  7. Accountability:<br />
     - Strengthening collaboration with non-state actors, including girl-led and women's rights organizations, male champions, and the private sector.<br />
     - Adopting and institutionalizing a multi-sectoral Gender Equality Framework (GEF) leadership structure to guide the implementation of GBV commitments.
  
  
  <br/><br>
  <strong>Challenges and Opportunities</strong><br/>
  Despite robust laws and policies, implementation remains sluggish. Barriers to seeking help and service delivery include low availability, accessibility, and quality of existing services, along with cultural factors that make reporting difficult. Data collection is narrow, often omitting economic violence, and service provision varies significantly across counties.
  <br />
  Opportunities for improvement include empowering Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) to collect quality data, leveraging social movements such as "Shut Down KE," and fostering cooperation between state and non-state actors.
  <br /><br />
  <strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
  Kenya has demonstrated a strong commitment to ending GBV through comprehensive legal and institutional frameworks, significant financial investments, and robust data collection mechanisms. Continued support for community-level prevention efforts and improved implementation of policies are essential for achieving the goal of eradicating GBV by 2026.

        <strong>VEILS OF INDIFFERENCE</strong><br /><br />
    
        <em>I am as blind as they are,<br />
        wrapped in the same fabric of<br />
        ignorance and conformity.</em><br /><br />
        In this sea of faceless figures,<br />
        each one shrouded in the same oppressive cloth,<br /> 
        we stumble through a world obscured by injustice.<br />
        The book I clutch to my chest is a symbol of truth and knowledge,<br /> 
        yet its weight is burdensome in a society that refuses to see.<br /><br />
    
        Surrounded by the masses, indistinguishable and mute,<br /> 
        we are prisoners of our own making.<br /> 
        The walls of conformity rise high,<br /> 
        and the voices of dissent are muffled<br />
        by the bandages that bind us.<br />
        Each step is a struggle against the tide of sameness,<br />
        each breath a gasp for the air of freedom and justice.<br /><br />
    
        In this bleak landscape, I realize that to fight injustice,<br /> 
        I must first unravel the bindings that obscure my vision.<br />
        I must become a beacon of hope, illuminating the path towards<br />
         equality and fairness.<br /> 
        The battle against injustice is not just external but within,<br />
         a fight to tear away the veils of indifference and prejudice.<br /><br />
    
        As I strive to confront the wrongs of the world,<br /> 
        I must ensure that my actions reflect the justice I seek.<br /> 
        It is through just means that true justice can be achieved.<br /> 
        The means <strong>should show justice.</strong>

      title: "GenZ and the Kenyan Revolution: A New Chapter in History",
      author: "Nzyoka M.",
      description: "An exploration of GenZ's role in the Kenyan protests, focusing on their mindset, language, and impact on history.",

        <strong>GenZ and the Kenyan Revolution: A New Chapter in History</strong><br /><br />
    
        The ongoing protests in Kenya, demanding the president's resignation, have highlighted the unique role of Generation Z, or "GenZ," in shaping the future of the nation. 
        This generation, born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s, is characterized by its digital fluency, global perspective, and strong desire for social justice. 
        In the context of the Kenyan protests, GenZ is not just participating in history; they are actively writing it.<br /><br />
    
        <strong>The Moment: Why Now?</strong><br /><br />
    
        The rise of GenZ in Kenya's political landscape comes at a critical moment in the country's history. 
        With increasing economic pressures, political dissatisfaction, and social inequalities, the conditions were ripe for a new wave of activism. 
        GenZ, having grown up in an era of rapid technological advancements and global connectivity, is uniquely positioned to lead this movement. 
        Their ability to quickly mobilize, share information, and create powerful narratives has transformed the protests into a dynamic and far-reaching movement.<br /><br />
    
        <strong>The Mindset: A New Way of Thinking</strong><br /><br />
    
        What sets GenZ apart from previous generations is their mindset. 
        They are deeply skeptical of traditional institutions, including the government and mainstream media, which they view as often corrupt or out of touch. 
        Instead, they rely on digital platforms to form communities, share ideas, and challenge the status quo. 
        This generation is also highly values-driven, with a strong emphasis on equality, transparency, and justice. 
        For them, activism is not just an occasional activity but a way of life, seamlessly integrated into their online and offline worlds.<br /><br />
    
        <strong>The Lingo: Language of the Revolution</strong><br /><br />
    
        The language used by GenZ in the Kenyan protests reflects their creativity and digital savvy. 
        Hashtags, memes, and short-form videos are their tools of communication, allowing them to spread messages quickly and effectively. 
        Phrases like "Wakenya Wamechoka" (Kenyans are tired) and "Vijana Tumechoka" (The youth are tired) have become rallying cries, encapsulating the frustrations and demands of the youth. 
        The use of colloquial language and internet slang makes the movement relatable and accessible, especially to younger audiences who may not engage with traditional forms of activism.<br /><br />
    
        <strong>The Movement: Part of a Global Wave</strong><br /><br />
    
        GenZ's involvement in the Kenyan protests is not an isolated phenomenon. 
        It is part of a broader global trend where young people are taking the lead in social and political movements. 
        From climate change strikes to anti-racism protests, GenZ has shown a remarkable ability to organize and inspire change. 
        In Kenya, this global awareness is reflected in the way GenZ activists connect local issues to broader struggles for justice and equality, drawing parallels with movements around the world.<br /><br />
    
        <strong>History-Making: Setting the Stage for the Future</strong><br /><br />
    
        As GenZ continues to play a pivotal role in the Kenyan protests, they are also shaping the future of the country. 
        Their actions today will be remembered as a significant chapter in Kenya's history, marking a turning point in the fight for justice and democracy. 
        By challenging existing power structures and advocating for a more inclusive and equitable society, GenZ is laying the groundwork for future generations to build upon.<br /><br />
    
        The story of GenZ and the Kenyan revolution is still unfolding, but one thing is clear: this generation is not just witnessing history; they are making it.
